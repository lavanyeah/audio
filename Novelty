REAL Novelty Point #1 (this is the strongest one)
Using text-derived acoustic parameters specifically to drive RIR generation
This is subtle but crucial.
Most systems do:
Text → audio
Or text → style → audio
Very few systems do:
Text → explicit acoustic parameters
→ RIR
→ audio
The use of RIR as the intermediate target is the novelty.
🔑 Key distinction:
You are not extracting parameters “for fun” — you are extracting them to synthesize an acoustic operator.
That coupling is rare and defensible.
REAL Novelty Point #2
Explicit separation between linguistic uncertainty and acoustic uncertainty
Most systems:
Collapse ambiguity into a single output
You can claim novelty if you:
Treat text as ambiguous by design
Output ranges / distributions of parameters
Propagate uncertainty into RIR generation
Example:
“cozy” → RT60 ∈ [0.35, 0.55]
“large hall” → RT60 ∈ [1.8, 2.6]
This is not common in audio pipelines.
This is not sexy — but it is technically meaningful.
REAL Novelty Point #3
Disentangling “environment acoustics” from “sound content” at the language level
Most prompt systems mix:
“play a piano”
“in a cathedral”
…inside one opaque model.
If your system:
Parses language into two orthogonal channels:
Source semantics
Environment acoustics
And enforces this separation architecturally
That is a real architectural novelty.
It’s not about new AI — it’s about system design discipline.
