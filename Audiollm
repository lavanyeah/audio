Proposed Architecture: Environment-Conditioned Audio Generation Using DS-RIR
1. Overview
This proposal integrates our idea of environment-conditioned generative audio with WO2025082633A1 (Device-Specific Room Impulse Response Generation).
The combined system enables realistic audio generation for both real and imagined environments, using text-based ambiance descriptions.
2. What the Patent Provides
The patent computes a Device-Specific Room Impulse Response (DS-RIR) by analyzing recorded audio and compensating for device/microphone effects.
It treats the room + device as a system
Uses system identification (deconvolution)
Outputs a reusable Room Impulse Response (RIR)
Important:
The patent does not generate audio content.
It generates an acoustic transformation that defines how sound behaves in a space.
3. Identified Gap
The patent assumes the environment is already known through recorded audio.
It does not support:
Imagined or hypothetical environments
Natural-language descriptions of ambiance
This limits its use when no physical room measurement exists.
4. Proposed Integrated Architecture
We add a semantic front-end before the patent’s pipeline.

5. Ambiance Interpretation (New Contribution)
This layer converts text into structured acoustic parameters.
Example input:
“A small cozy living room with a sofa and bookshelf.”
Example output:
Approximate room dimensions
Surface materials
Furniture absorption/diffusion
Expected reverberation range
This can be implemented using:
Acoustic defaults
Learned semantic priors
LLM-based parameter inference
Exact precision is not required; perceptual plausibility is sufficient.
6. How Ambiance Helps RIR Generation
The inferred parameters act as a proxy for physical measurement.
They guide the RIR generation process when real audio recordings are unavailable, enabling acoustic instantiation of imagined spaces.
7. Audio Generation and Use
Once generated, the RIR can be:
Convolved with dry or generated audio, or
Used as conditioning input for generative audio models
This ensures acoustic realism is embedded in the waveform, not added later.
8. Runtime Behavior
RIR generation runs once per environment
Audio generation can run multiple times using the same RIR
Efficient and scalable
9. Summary
The patent provides a robust way to learn how sound behaves in a space.
Our addition enables the system to infer that space from text when recordings do not exist.
Together, they form a practical foundation for environment-conditioned generative audio.
